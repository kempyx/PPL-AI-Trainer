<ul>
	<li>The app is designed for PPL, LAPL, NLA and ultralight aircraft students, but can also be used by CPL and ATPL students to practice for exams.</li>
	<li>All questions are checked against the EASA learning objectives. EU-states must follow these objectives when designing examinations. Therefore, students from any EU state can use the app for exam preparation.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1. Newbie Guide</strong></p>

<p><strong>Getting started</strong><br />
The question database is built around the nine core EASA subjects. Each subject is further divided into a number of subcategories (following the EASA Learning Objective structure). If you click on a subject, you will be given the following options:</p>

<p>20 questions<br />
Clicking here will initiate a sample exam with 20 random questions from the subject.<br />
<br />
Free Exam<br />
Clicking here will allow you to choose the number of questions in your exam. The Free Exam also allows you to limit your questions to either previously incorrectly answered questions (the red statistics bar) or previously unanswered questions (the white statistics bar).<br />
<br />
Show Subcategories<br />
Clicking here will take you to the subcategory view. Each subcategory is shown with the current statistic bar in white, red and green, which can be used to check which areas needs brushing up before your actual exam. From this prompt, you may choose to perform an exam in a single subcategory. Some subcategories contain only a few questions; however this corresponds to the EASA regulation and is normal.<br />
<br />
<strong>Viewing attachments</strong><br />
Hundreds of questions come with attachments. Some attachments are shown before an answer is selected, and some attachments are only presented as part of the explanation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Moving to the next question</strong><br />
There are three ways to proceed to the next question. Either click the arrow in the top right corner, or click on the text &ldquo;next question&rdquo; in the bottom centre, or slide from right to left on your screen. You can also go back to previously answered questions by clicking the back arrow or sweeping from left to right.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Additional information<br />
<br />
What does the app cost?</strong><br />
The first 24 hours are free with full access to the unlimited database. Following the free period, you can choose to buy full access for one month, three months or twelve months, the latter two at a discount rate. This includes full access to the whole database and all app functionalities. Unlike many other apps for flight training, we do not believe in selling subjects separately.</p>

<p><strong>Can I download high resolution attachments?</strong><br />
Yes, of course! All our attachments are available for download by clicking&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wae2eh3nhohp8ss/AACFPXqLnE-xquKvIkN7Dyk0a?dl=0">here</a>&nbsp;or by using this link:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/sh/wae2eh3nhohp8ss/AACFPXqLnE-xquKvIkN7Dyk0a?dl=0">www.dropbox.com/sh/wae2eh3nhohp8ss/AACFPXqLnE-xquKvIkN7Dyk0a?dl=0</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We recommend at least downloading and printing the map (used in Navigation and Flight Planning) since you will be required to find tracks and measure distances.</p>

<p><strong>Regarding the mock aeroplane flight manual</strong><br />
Within the scope of the subject &ldquo;Flight Planning&rdquo; many questions come with attachments from a mock airplane flight manual. Unfortunately, European states have NOT agreed on a standard mock manual. This means that each state will use a different mock manual. We&rsquo;ve developed our own mock manual, called the LA-92 Pilot Operating Handbook. Please note that while our mock manual takes inspiration from several European examination mock manuals, it is not the one you&rsquo;ll see at your exam. Our mock manual covers the required knowledge and you will practice the correct methods for each calculation; but the data may be presented differently on your actual exam.</p>

<br />
<strong>Regarding subcategories in Meteorology</strong><br />
For reasons unknown to us, EASA minimum requirements in the subject Meteorology are limited. In reality, the subject is one of the largest and most comprehensive as examined across European states. Because of this, we&rsquo;ve decided to complement the subject with about ten &lsquo;new&rsquo; subcategories. The European states have previously and will continue to require this knowledge from their students, and the app would be incomplete without these questions and subcategories.<br />
<br />
<strong>What about national rules?</strong><br />
There are a few subcategories (mainly in Air Law) requiring the student to know the rules of their licensing state. This means that you will have to find and learn any differences from EASA and ICAO standards existing in your own country. In most cases, these rules are in the minority. The app is and will always be up to date with the European- and ICAO rules.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Feedback</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is feedback?</strong><br />
We&rsquo;re very proud of our feedback function. It can be used to send us information regarding an incorrect question, incorrect explanation or grammatical errors. Because of the feedback from our students, the app is constantly growing and being polished. We encourage you to write feedback on anything that comes to mind. We love to read it!<br />
<br />
<strong>Will you respond to my feedback?</strong><br />
Yes! If you&rsquo;re logged in to your account and it contains an email, we try to reply to feedback given, and inform you of any action taken. You may also provide the email address in the feedback directly. So please, send us our feedback. You can also request a response in the feedback directly.</p>

<p><strong>4. Frequently asked questions</strong></p>

<p><strong>How is it possible to publish a single app across Europe?</strong><br />
Since the advent of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the decision of the EU to standardize the European aviation rules, things have become less complicated. In late 2013 EASA published the standardized European rules for flight crew certification, streamlining flight training across the European Union. This means that for the very first time in history, flight training tools can be used universially across the European Union.</p>

<p><strong>Are these questions relevant for my country?</strong><br />
Yes, as long as you are in a EU state or if your state has signed into EASA (most non-EU European states have). Every single question in the app comes with a reference to a EASA learning objective. You can see the reference at the bottom of the screen when you&rsquo;ve selected your answer. Since every EU-state is required to adhere to the EASA learning objectives, the questions are relevant. We&rsquo;ve also used a few (usually more detailed) national documents to make sure every gap and crevice are filled and examined in the app. But please note that national rules are not implemented in the app, and they MAY appear on your national exams. See <em>&ldquo;What about national rules?&rdquo; </em>above.</p>

<p><strong>Where did you get all these questions?</strong><br />
We&rsquo;ve developed them ourselves. The English question database has been developed and translated from a Swedish question database (also developed and published by us) that reached the market in 2013. The database had been used for over two years at the time of translation. The continuous stream of feedback has provided us with a very polished database, which supported the translation.<br />
